    <string name="explore_dungeon_screen_goblins">Shadows dance on the uneven walls of the dungeon, brought to life by the light of %1$s\'s torch.
        The air is stale and damp. The only testimony of life are countless trails of small dusty footprints that seemingly lead nowhere.
        One particular trail seems fresh. %1$s starts to follow them.
        \n After following the tracks for several tense minutes, %1$s reaches a room closed off with a shoddy wooden door.
        Sounds of rustling and metallic clanking come from within.

    <string name="explore_dungeon_screen_skeleton_rat">The dungeon opens up to a larger room, accommodating crumbling vases and sarcophagi.
        The ancient artifacts are covered in a thick layer of dust. Cobwebs hang from the ceiling, some inhabited by skittering crawlers.
The room is beset by an eerie silence, sometimes broken by sharp squeaks. Bones litter the floor around a stone door which shows no handle.

    <string name="explore_dungeon_screen_slime">%1$s\'s footsteps echo in the silent halls of the dungeon. This part of the dungeon is suspiciously clean.
        Not a single cobweb decorates these worn halls. After a several minutes walk, faint sounds of bubbling reach %1$\'s ears.
        The bubbling grows louder as %1$s approaches its source, stopping at an iron grate. The popping sounds can be heard from within.
